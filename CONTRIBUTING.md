Contributions of any kind are welcome at any time, please just follow these very basic guides to keep a minimum of consitency:
- add your own subfolder (please use a meaningful name) in either category `examples` or `pathces` (more might follow if the need arises)
- your submission should contain its own little README
- add your submission to the list in the main README
